## A React SPA to display the stock holdings of Ark Invest.

* Each of Arks 6 ETFs has its own component in the app. The most exciting feature is the component under "ALL" where every stock own throughout all 
* the ETFs are counted. This allows the user to get a better view of what Ark own throughout the entire fund. I pull Arks Invests data from my
* Ark Api and I also pull stock information from several other APIs. 

* After receiving feedback from users, I am working on another iteration of the app.
